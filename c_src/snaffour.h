/** Polynomials
 *
 * A Polynomials manages two arrays, one containing terms and one containing
 * coefficients.  Using two arrays saves memory since a term must be stored in
 * memory which is aligned to 16 bytes while a coefficient only occupies 8
 * bytes.
 *
 * The rank indicates the number of variables, i.e. the rank of the parent ring.
 * Loops which deal with the exponents as separate bytes use this to avoid
 * iterating through the unused exponents which, incidentally, are expected to
 * all be zero.
 *
 * The array terms of Term_t types must be maintained in sorted order by
 * descending grevlex.  This means that adding or subtracting two Polynomials is
 * done by interleaving the lists of terms and coefficients, or just the
 * coefficients in the compact case, and occasionally combining two coefficients
 * in the relatively rare case where a term appears in both Polynomials.
 * Finding the coefficient of a Term in a Polynomial is done by bisection, which
 * assumes that the term arrays be ordered.
 *
 * The zero polynomial typically has num_terms=0 and both pointers equal to
 * NULL.  However, any polynomial with num_terms=0 is equal to 0.  The meaning
 * of num_terms is algebraic -- it does not indicate how much memory has been
 * allocated for the Polynomial.
 *
 * In our Cython implementaton, a Polynomial object holds a Polynomial_t within
 * the object data structure.  So the task of allocating and deallocating
 * Polynomials is almost always handled by Python.  The task of allocating and
 * deallocating the arrays of terms and coefficients is handled by this C
 * library.  (The Cython __cinit__ and __dealloc__ methods call Poly_alloc
 * and Poly_free.)

/** Rows in a Polynomial Matrix
 *
 * A Row is a compact representation of a Polynomial used when
 * computing echelon forms. A row saves memory by using a sorted
 * external table of terms.  The term_order element of the coefficient
 * is an index into the external table.  The external table is shared
 * among all rows in a matrix.  This saves both space and time. The
 * basic row operation consists primarily of copying coefficients from
 * one row to another, based on a comparison of the associated
 * terms. Terms can be compared by comparing their indices, which is
 * much faster than comparing them as vectors, even with MMX
 * instructions.  And copying 8 bytes is much faster than copying 40
 * bytes.  The row also saves time by storing the values of the
 * coefficients in their Montgomery representation, which allows fast
 * reduction of products mod P.  This is important because the other
 * major component of the basic row operation row_i -> row_i + a*row_j
 * is that every non-zero coefficient in row_j must be multiplied by
 * a.

 * The distributive law implies M(X) + M(Y) = M(X+Y).  However, M(X)*M(Y) is

 * computing the Montgomery representative of a product requires being able to
 * divide by R mod p.  The point of choosing R to be a power of 2 is that this
 * can be done without using hardware division.
 *
 * Given X in [0, p^2) the following macro computes an element of [0, 2p)
 * representing X/R in Fp. It requires a precomputed constant mu in [0, p)
 * such that mu represents -1/R in Fp.  (Hardware division can by used to
 * compute mu, since it is only done once per echelon form.)  The macro uses 2
 * multiplies, 2 AND operations 1 addition and a shift.  At most one extra
 * subtraction is needed to compute the standard representative of X/R in Fp.
 *
 * NOTE: the arguments for the macro must be 64 bits wide to avoid overflow!!!
