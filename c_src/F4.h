/** Polynomials
 * 
 * We use separate arrays for terms and coefficients to avoid wasting memory
 * because the terms must be aligned to 16 bytes, while the coefficients are
 * only 8 bytes each.
 *
 * The rank indicates the number of variables, i.e. the rank of the parent ring.
 * Loops which deal with the exponents as separate bytes use this to avoid
 * iterating through the unused exponents which, incidentally, are expected to
 * all be zero.
 *
 * The array terms of Term_t types must be maintained in sorted order by
 * descendng grevlex.  Adding or subtracting two Polynomials is done by
 * interleaving the lists of terms and coefficients, and occasionally combining
 * two coefficients in the relatively rare case where a term appears in both
 * Polynomials.  Finding the coefficient of a Term in a Polynomial is done by
 * bisection, which assumes that the term arrays be ordered.
 *
 * The zero polynomial typically has num_terms=0 and both pointers equal to NULL.
 * However, any polynomial with num_terms=0 is equal to 0.  The meaning of
 * num_terms is algebraic -- it does not indicate how much memory has been
 * allocated for the Polynomial.
 *
 * In our Cython implementaton, a Polynomial object holds a Polynomial_t within
 * the object data structure.  So the task of allocating and deallocating
 * Polynomials is almost always handled by Python.  The task of allocating and
 * deallocating the arrays of terms and coefficients is handled by this C
 * library.  (The Cython __cinit__ and __dealloc__ methods call Poly_alloc
 * and Poly_free.)
