/** Polynomials
 *
 * Polynomials come in two flavors.  The standard flavor has two arrays,
 * one containing terms and one containing coefficients.  Using two arrays
 * saves memory since a term must be stored in memory which is aligned to
 * 16 bytes while a coefficient only occupies 8 bytes.
 *
 * The second "compact" flavor saves even more memory by using an external table
 * of terms.  The term_order element of the coefficient is an index into the
 * external table, and the internal term pointer is NULL.  The external table
 * can be shared among several polynomials. This is done when computing the
 * echelon form of a "matrix" whose "rows" are Polynomials.  This saves both
 * space and time.  The basic row operation consists primarily of copying
 * coefficients from one row to another, based on a comparison of the associated
 * terms. Terms can be compared by comparing their indices, which is much faster
 * than comparing them as vectors, even with MMX instructions.  And copying 8
 * bytes is much faster than copying 40 bytes.  The compact flavor also saves
 * time by storing the values of the coefficients in their Montgomery
 * representation, which allows fast reduction of products mod P.  This is
 * important because the other major component of the basic row operation
 * row_i -> row_i + a*row_j is that every non-zero coefficient in row_j must
 * be multiplied by a.
 *
 * A Polynomial in compact form should have its terms element set to NULL and
 * each coefficient should have a non-negative column_index.  A Polynomial in
 * standard form should have its table element set to NULL and each column_index
 * should be set to INDEX_UNSET.
 *
 * The rank indicates the number of variables, i.e. the rank of the parent ring.
 * Loops which deal with the exponents as separate bytes use this to avoid
 * iterating through the unused exponents which, incidentally, are expected to
 * all be zero.
 *
 * The array terms of Term_t types, or the external table must be maintained in
 * sorted order by descending grevlex.  This means that adding or subtracting
 * two Polynomials is done by interleaving the lists of terms and coefficients,
 * or just the coefficients in the compact case, and occasionally combining two
 * coefficients in the relatively rare case where a term appears in both
 * Polynomials.  Finding the coefficient of a Term in a Polynomial is done by
 * bisection, which assumes that the term arrays be ordered.
 *
 * The zero polynomial typically has num_terms=0 and both pointers equal to NULL.
 * However, any polynomial with num_terms=0 is equal to 0.  The meaning of
 * num_terms is algebraic -- it does not indicate how much memory has been
 * allocated for the Polynomial.
 *
 * In our Cython implementaton, a Polynomial object holds a Polynomial_t within
 * the object data structure.  So the task of allocating and deallocating
 * Polynomials is almost always handled by Python.  The task of allocating and
 * deallocating the arrays of terms and coefficients is handled by this C
 * library.  (The Cython __cinit__ and __dealloc__ methods call Poly_alloc
 * and Poly_free.)
