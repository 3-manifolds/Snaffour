Snaffour
========

Description
-----------

Snaffour is an implementation of Faugère's F4 algorithm for computing
Gröbner bases of ideals in polynomial rings.  This implementation is
for polynomials over a finite field of prime order, where currently
the order is always 2^31 - 1.

Snaffour is a Python extension module, written in Cython, with low
level computations implemented directly in C.

This is an alpha release and is not ready to be used.
