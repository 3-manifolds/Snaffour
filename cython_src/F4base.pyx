        product t*g which is used in reducing a term of the s-polynomial is
        included in the matrix.  It can be recognized because its head term will
        not appear among the head terms of the rows of the initial matrix.  The
        purpose of the preprocessing step is to add all such multiples of
        elements of G_n to the matrix.

        There is a serious, but easily fixable error in the pseudocode for the
        preprocessing subalgorithm in FaugÃ¨re's paper, and this error can lead
        to incorrect computations.  He says to begin the preprocessing by
        replacing each product in the list L by its simplification.  He proves
        in Theorem 2.4 that the final G will be a Groebner basis if, for each
        distinct g1, g2 in G, the s-polynomial of their simplifications g1' and
        g2' has a t-representation with respect to G such that t < lcm(g1, g2).
        So it would appear to be sufficient that the simplifications of the
        products in L_n should all reduce to 0 modulo G.  The problem with this
        reasoning is that it ignores the degenerate case where g1 and g2 have
        the same simplification.  In that case the s-polynomial of g1' and g2'
        is zero, and the zero polynomial does not have t-representation by
        Definition 2.7. So Theorem 2.4 does not apply.  What happens in this
        case is that the matrix will have two identical rows, which appeared in
        a previous matrix, and the new head term which should have appeared in
        the s-polynomial of g1 and g2 will be missing from the final basis.  We
        observed this happening, and producing a non-Groebner basis, with the
        Cyclic-4 example when using the identity selection process that selects
        all pairs, as well as in some of the Buchberger selection processes that
        select one pair.

        We mention that FaugÃ¨re's paper omits the proof of correctness of the F4
        algorithm.  Instead it (mis)states a Theorem from the book by T. Becker
        and V. Weispfenning along with Theorem 2.4, and says that these two results
        could be used in a proof of correctness, without actually giving the proof.

        This is the Symbolic Preprocessing subalgorithm of FaugÃ¨re's F4 algorithm,
        modified to correct the error discussed above.

        The Simplify subalgorithm of F4.

        INPUT:
          * t, a term
          * q, a polynomial

        OUTPUT:
          * (u, g), where :math:`HT(u\star g) = HT(t\star q)` and (u,g) is simpler
            in the sense that the term u divides t, usually properly, and g is a row
            of a previously computed echelon form. The term u will be as small as
            possible.  This means that the new row :math:`u\star g` will be as close
            as possible to a previously computed row.

        NOTE: There are three serious typos in the description of this algorithm
        in FaugÃ¨re's paper.  First he says:

        "there exists a (unique) :math:`p` in :math:`\tilde F^+_j` such that
        :math:`HT(P) = HT(u\star f)`".

        That is absurd since :math:`HT(u\star q)` is in :math:`HT(F_j)` and
        :math:`\tilde F_j^+` is constructed by removing all elements of
        :math:`\tilde F_j` having a head term
        in :math:`HT(F_j)`.  He means that :math:`p` is in :math:`\tilde F_j`.

        Second, he says: ":math:`u\star f` is in :math:`F_j`" when he means
        ":math:`HT(u\star f)` is in :math:`HT(F_j)`".

        The first typo is fixed in his 2013 slide presentation.  While the
        second typo is not fixed in the slides, his example shows that he is
        only looking at head terms (i.e. top reducibility).  As he explains in
        the slides, the goal of the simplification is to:

        "replace any product :math:`m\star f` by a product :math:`u\star t\star f'`
        where :math:`t\star f'` is a previously computed row and :math:`u\star t`
        divides the monomial :math:`m`"

        By "previously computed row" he means a row of of an echelon form
        :math:`\tilde F_j`.  The example suggests that he means that (t, f) should be
        replaced by (u, g) where g is a previously computed row and HT(t*f) =
        HT((u*g) with u < t.  The pseudocode in the paper generates (u, g) such
        that u|t and the proof of Lemma 2.3 assumes that u|t, but the statement
        does not assert it.  It is unclear whether he only needs the statement
        of the Lemma, of if he actually uses the proof at some point.

        Third, the algorithm, as presented, enters an infinite loop if passed a
        pair (t,f) with f in F and f in F_ech but t != 1.  In that case u = 1,
        since 1*f is in F, so u != t and f = p and the algorithm says to
        recursively call simplify(t/u, f) with t/u = t.  We need to handle this
        by stopping the recursion in this case.
