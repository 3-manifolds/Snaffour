    def simplify(self, Term t, Polynomial q):
        r"""
        The Simplify subalgorithm of F4.

        INPUT:
          * t, a term
          * q, a polynomial

        OUTPUT:
          * (u, g), where :math:`HT(u\star g) = HT(t\star q)` and (u,g) is simpler
            in the sense that the term u divides t, usually properly, and g is a row
            of a previously computed echelon form. The term u will be as small as
            possible.  This means that the new row :math:`u\star g` will be as close
            as possible to a previously computed row.

        NOTE: There are three serious typos in the description of this algorithm
        in FaugÃ¨re's paper.  First he says:

        "there exists a (unique) :math:`p` in :math:`\tilde F^+_j` such that
        :math:`HT(P) = HT(u\star f)`".

        That is absurd since :math:`HT(u\star q)` is in :math:`HT(F_j)` and
        :math:`\tilde F_j^+` is constructed by removing all elements of
        :math:`\tilde F_j` having a head term
        in :math:`HT(F_j)`.  He means that :math:`p` is in :math:`\tilde F_j`.

        Second, he says: ":math:`u\star f` is in :math:`F_j`" when he means
        ":math:`HT(u\star f)` is in :math:`HT(F_j)`".

        The first typo is fixed in his 2013 slide presentation.  While the
        second typo is not fixed in the slides, his example shows that he is
        only looking at head terms (i.e. top reducibility).  As he explains in
        the slides, the goal of the simplification is to:

        "replace any product :math:`m\star f` by a product :math:`u\star t\star f'`
        where :math:`t\star f'` is a previously computed row and :math:`u\star t`
        divides the monomial :math:`m`"

        By "previously computed row" he means a row of of an echelon form
        :math:`\tilde F_j`.  The example suggests that he means that (t, f) should be
        replaced by (u, g) where g is a previously computed row and HT(t*f) =
        HT((u*g) with u < t.  The pseudocode in the paper generates (u, g) such
        that u|t and the proof of Lemma 2.3 assumes that u|t, but the statement
        does not assert it.  It is unclear whether he only needs the statement
        of the Lemma, of if he actually uses the proof at some point.

        Third, the algorithm, as presented, enters an infinite loop if passed a
        pair (t,f) with f in F and f in F_ech but t != 1.  In that case u = 1,
        since 1*f is in F, so u != t and f = p and the algorithm says to
        recursively call simplify(t/u, f) with t/u = t.  We need to handle this
        by stopping the recursion in this case.
