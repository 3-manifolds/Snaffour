        This method returns the matrix (as a list of polynomials) which will be
        reduced to echelon form in the main loop.  The input L consists of the
        unevaluated left and right products (term times polynomial) for the
        selected pairs.  For each pair, the difference between these two
        products is the s-polynomial.  If the s-polynomial does not reduce to 0
        modulo :math:`G_n` then its reduction must be added to :math:`G_n` when
        constructing :math:`G_{n+1}`.  The reduction will appear as a row of the
        echelon form, provided that each product :math:`t\star g` which is used
        in reducing a term of the s-polynomial is included in the matrix.  It
        can be recognized because its head term will not appear among the head
        terms of the rows of the initial matrix.  The purpose of the
        preprocessing step is to add all such multiples of elements of
        :math:`G_n` to the matrix.

        There is a serious, but easily fixable error in the pseudocode for the
        preprocessing subalgorithm in FaugÃ¨re's paper, and this error can lead
        to incorrect computations.  He says to begin the preprocessing by
        replacing each product in the list L by its simplification.  He proves
        in Theorem 2.4 that the final :math:`G` will be a Groebner basis if, for
        each distinct :math:`g_1, g_2` in :math:`G`, the s-polynomial of their
        simplifications :math:`g_1'` and :math:`g_2'` has a t-representation
        with respect to :math:`G` such that :math:`t < lcm(g_1, g_2)`.  So it
        would appear to be sufficient that the simplifications of the products
        in :math:`L_n` should all reduce to 0 modulo :math:`G`.  The problem
        with this reasoning is that it ignores the degenerate case where
        :math:`g_1` and :math:`g_2` have the same simplification.  In that case
        the s-polynomial of :math:`g_1'` and :math:`g_2'` is zero, and the zero
        polynomial does not have a t-representation by Definition 2.7. So
        Theorem 2.4 does not apply.  What happens in this case is that the
        matrix will have two identical rows, which appeared in a previous
        matrix, and the new head term which appears in the s-polynomial of
        :math:`g_1` and :math:`g_2` will be missing from the final basis.  One
        can observe this happening, and producing a non-Groebner basis, with the
        Cyclic-4 example when using the identity selection process that selects
        all pairs, as well as in some of the Buchberger-type selection processes
        that select one pair.

        We mention that FaugÃ¨re's paper omits the proof of correctness of the F4
        algorithm.  Instead it states Theorem 5.64 from the book by T. Becker
        and V. Weispfenning along with Theorem 2.4, and says that these two results
        could be used in a proof of correctness, without actually giving the proof.

        This method is the *Symbolic Preprocessing* subalgorithm of FaugÃ¨re's F4
        algorithm, modified to correct the error discussed above.

        This method is the *Simplify* subalgorithm of F4.  Its effect is to reduce
        the size and complexity of the echelon forms.

        INPUT:
          * t, a term
          * q, a polynomial

        OUTPUT:
          * (u, g), where :math:`HT(u\star g) = HT(t\star q)` and :math:`(u, g)` is
            simpler in the sense that the term :math:`u` divides :math:`t`,
            usually properly, and :math:`g` is a row of a previously computed
            echelon form. The term :math:`u` will be as small as possible.  This
            means that the new row :math:`u\star g` will be as close as possible
            to a previously computed row.

        NOTE: There are three typos to be aware of in the description of this
        algorithm in FaugÃ¨re's paper.  First he says:

          "there exists a (unique) :math:`p` in :math:`\tilde F^+_j` such that
          :math:`HT(p) = HT(u\star f)`".

        This is only true if j is chosen to be the smallest integer such that
        :math:`\tilde F_j` contains a row with head term :math:`HT(u\star f)`.
        So he is implicitly assuming that the echelon forms are searched in
        order of increasing j.  In fact, it is sufficient for p to be in
        :math:`\tilde F_j` for any j, and our experiments indicate that it is
        much more efficient to search in order of descending j.

        Second, he says: ":math:`u\star f` is in :math:`F_j`" when he means
        ":math:`HT(u\star f)` is in :math:`HT(F_j)`".

        The plus exponent disappears in his 2013 slide presentation.  While the
        second typo is not fixed in the slides, his example shows that he is
        only looking at head terms (i.e. top reducibility).  As he explains in
        the slides, the goal of the simplification is to:

          "replace any product :math:`m\star f` by a product :math:`u\star t\star f'`
          where :math:`t\star f'` is a previously computed row and :math:`u\star t`
          divides the monomial :math:`m`"

        By "previously computed row" he means a row of of an echelon form
        :math:`\tilde F_j`.  The example suggests that he means that (t, f) should be
        replaced by (u, g) where g is a previously computed row and HT(t*f) =
        HT((u*g) with u < t.  The pseudocode in the paper generates (u, g) such
        that u|t and the proof of Lemma 2.3 assumes that u|t, but the statement
        does not assert it.  It is unclear whether he only needs the statement
        of the Lemma, of if he actually uses the proof at some point.

        Third, the algorithm, as presented, enters an infinite loop if passed a
        pair (t,f) with f in F and f in F_ech but t != 1.  In that case u = 1,
        since 1*f is in F, so u != t and f = p and the algorithm says to
        recursively call simplify(t/u, f) with t/u = t.  This does not arise in
        this implementation since we avoid recursion altogether.
